Good afternoon, everybody. Thank you all for joining me today. 
To my lovely wife, my first lady -- couple of days, we're going to be married 30 years. 
To the City Council members; to Sergeant Kimera Woods -- that was a beautiful rendition, 
didn't you think? Really nice. 
Representing the men and women of the New Orleans Police Department, Homeland Security, 
EMS -- all of the individuals who have done really hard work over the last month under very 
difficult circumstances, and so Chief Harrison and Tim McConnell, and our entire team at City 
Hall who are here today; and particularly Glenda and Mary, who are sitting at the front desk of 
City Hall that has received all the warm blessings. I think they're watching right now but 
before I came over here I asked Mary how we were doing. She said, "Well chief," she said, 
"they called you everything but a child of God."
To Matt Bailey and to U.S. Marine Corps retired Lieutenant Colonel Richard Westmoreland, 
who have been there every step of the way on behalf of the United States of America. Thank 
you for being strong.
Pastor Anglim, and to all the ministers who prayed and gave us strength.
To Keith Plessy, from the Plessy family, who brings a history from where it was to where it is 
today, and along with the Ferguson family who are not here but have demonstrated what 
reconciliation really looks like.

The descendants of Georgetown slaves.
And to the New Orleans Freedom Riders -- Diane Nash couldn't make it today, but Claude 
Reese is here, who was -- give him a round of applause.
I thank you all for coming today.
The soul of our beloved city is rooted in a history that has evolved over thousands of years; 
rooted in a diverse people who have been here together every step of the way through good 
and through bad.
It is the history, our history, that holds in its heart the stories of Native Americans -- the 
Choctaw, the Nation, the Chitimacha; Hernando de Soto, Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle, 
the Acadians, the Islenos, the enslaved people of Senegambia, free people of color, the 
Haitians, the Germans, both empires of France and Spain; the Italian[s], the Irish, the 
Cubans, the south and central Americans, the Vietnamese, and so many more.
You see, New Orleans is truly a city of many nations, a melting pot, a bubbling cauldron of 
many cultures. There is no other place quite like it in the world that so eloquently exemplifies 
the uniquely American motto: E pluribus unum -- Out of many we are one.
But there are also other truths about our city that we must confront. New Orleans was one of 
America’s largest slave markets, a port where hundreds of thousands of souls were bought, 
sold, and shipped up the Mississippi River to lives of forced labor, of misery, of rape, and of 
torture.
America was a place where nearly 4,000 of our fellow American citizens were lynched, 540 in 
Louisiana alone; where our courts enshrined "separate but equal," where Freedom Riders 
were beaten to a bloody pulp.
So when people say to me that the monuments in question are history, well what I just 
described to you is our history as well, and it is a searing truth. And it immediately begs the 
question, why there are no slave ship monuments, no prominent markers on public land to 
remember the lynchings or the slave blocks; nothing to remember this long chapter of our 
lives of the pain, of sacrifice, of shame -- all of it happening on the soil of New Orleans.
So for those self-appointed defenders of history and the monuments, they are eerily silent on 
what amounts to historical malfeasance, a lie by omission. There is a difference, you see, 
between remembrance of history and the reverence of it. For America [and] New Orleans, it 
has been a long and winding road, marked by tragedy and triumph. But we cannot be afraid 
of the truth. As President George W. Bush said at the -- at the dedication ceremony for the 
National Museum of African American History and Culture (and I quote): “A great nation does 
not hide its history. It faces its flaws and" it "corrects them.”
So today I want to speak about why we chose to remove these four monuments to the Lost 
Cause of the Confederacy, but also how and why this process can move us towards healing 
and understanding each other.
So, let’s start with the facts.
The historic record is clear: Robert E. Lee, Jeff[erson] Davis, P.G.T. Beauregard statu[es] were 
not erected to just honor these men, but as part of the movement which became known as 
The Cult of the Lost Cause. This "cult" had one goal and one goal only: through monuments 
and through other means to rewrite history, to hide the truth, which is that the Confederacy 
was on the wrong side of humanity. First erected 166 years after the founding of our city, 19 
years after the Civil War, these monuments that we took down were meant to rebrand the 
history of our city and the ideals of the Confederacy.
It is self-evident that these men did not fight for the United States of America; they fought 
against it. They may have been warriors, but in this cause they were not patriots.
These statu[es] are not just stone and metal. They're not just innocent remembrances of a 
benign history. These monuments celebrate a fictional, sanitized Confederacy: ignoring the 
death, ignoring the enslavement, ignoring the terror that it actually stood for. And after the 
Civil War, these monuments were part of that terrorism as much as burning cross on 
someone’s lawn. They were erected purposefully to send a strong message to all who walked 
in their shadows about who was still in charge in this city.
Now, should you have any doubt about the true goals of the Confederacy, in the very weeks 
before the war broke out, the Vice President of the Confederacy, Alexander Stephens, made it 
very clear that the Confederate cause was about maintaining slavery and white supremacy.
In his now famous "Cornerstone speech," he said that the Confederacy’s:
corner-stone rests, upon the great truth, that the negro is not equal to the white man; 
that slavery -- subordination to a superior race -- is his natural and his normal 
condition. This, our new government --
he said,
-- is the first, in the history of the world, based upon this great physical, philosophical, 
and moral truth.
Now, with these shocking words still ringing in your ears, I want to try to gently peel your 
hands from the grip on this false narrative of our history that I think weakens us and make 
straight a wrong turn that we made many years ago, so we can more closely connect with the 
integrity to the founding principles of our nation and forge a clearer, straighter path towards a 
better city and towards a more perfect union.
Now, last year President Barack Obama echoed these sentiments about the need to 
contextualize and to remember all of our history. He recalled a single piece of stone, a slave 
auction block engraved with a marker commemorating a single moment in 1830 when Andrew 
Jackson and Henry Clay stood and spoke from it.
President Obama said, 
Consider what this artifact tells us about history....On a stone where day after day, for 
years, men and women... bound and bought and sold, and bid like cattle; on a stone 
worn down by the tragedy of over a thousand bare feet.
And,
For a long time the only thing we considered important, the singular thing we chose to 
commemorate as "history" with a plaque were the unmemorable speeches of two 
powerful men.
A piece of stone -- one stone. Both stories, history. One story told, one story forgotten -- or 
maybe even purposefully ignored.
Now, as clear as it is for me today, for a long time, even though I grew up in one of New 
Orleans' most diverse neighborhoods, even with my family's proud history of fighting for civil 
rights, I must have passed by these monuments thousands of times without giving them a 
second thought.
So I'm not judging anybody. I am not judging people. We all take our own journey on race. I 
just hope people listen like I did when my dear friend Wynton Marsalis helped me see the 
truth. He asked me to think about all the people who have left New Orleans because of our 
exclusionary attitudes.
Another friend asked me to consider these four monuments from the perspective of an African 
American mother or father trying to explain to their fifth grade daughter why Robert E. Lee 
sat atop of our city. Can you do it? Can you do it? Can you look into the eyes of this young girl 
and convince her that Robert E. Lee is there to encourage her? Do you think she feels inspired 
and hopeful by that story? Do these monuments help her see her future with limitless 
potential? Have you ever thought, have you every thought that if her potential is limited, 
yours and my potential [is limited] as well?
We all know the answers to these very simple questions.
When you look into this child’s eyes is the moment when the searing truth comes into focus. 
This is the moment when we know what we must do, when we know what is right. We can not 
walk away from this truth.
Now, I knew that taking down the monuments was going to be tough, but you elected me to 
do the right thing, not the easy thing, and this is what that looks like. So relocating these 
monuments is not about taking something away from someone else. This is not about politics. 
It's not about blame. It's not about retaliation. This is not about a naïve quest to solve all of 
our problems at once.
This is, however, about showing the whole world that we as a city, that we as a people are 
able to acknowledge, to understand, to reconcile, and more importantly, choose a better 
future for ourselves, making straight what has been crooked and making right what was 
wrong. Otherwise, we will continue to pay a price with discord, with division, and yeah, 
violence.
To literally put the Confederacy on a pedestal in our mo[st] prominent places [of] honor is an 
inaccurate recitation of our full past. It is an affront to our present. And it is a bad prescription 
for our future.
History cannot be changed. It cannot be moved like a statue. What is done is done. The Civil 
War is over. The Confederacy lost -- and we're better for it. Surely we are far enough 
removed from this dark time to acknowledge that the cause of the Confederacy was wrong. 
And in the second decade of the 21st century, asking African Americans -- or anyone else for 
that matter -- to drive by property that they own; occupied by reverential statu[es] of men 
who fought to destroy the country and deny that person’s humanity seems perverse. It seems 
absurd. Century-old wounds are still raw because, you see, they never healed right in the first 
place.
So here is the essential truth: We are better together than we are apart. Indivisibility is our 
essence. Isn’t this the gift that we, the people of New Orleans, have given to the world?
We radiate beauty and grace -- in our food, in our music, in our architecture, in our joy of life, 
in our celebration of death; in everything that we do. We gave the world this funky thing 
called jazz. It is the most uniquely American art form that is developed across the ages and 
from different cultures. Think about second lines; think about Mardi Gras; think about 
muffaletta; think about the Saints; think about gumbo; think about red beans and rice. By 
God, just think: All we hold dear is created by throwing everything in the pot -- creating, 
producing something better; everything, everything a product of our historic diversity.
We are proof that out of many we are one -- and better for it. Out of many we are one -- and 
we really do love it.
And yet, and yet we still seem to find so many excuses to not do the right thing. President 
Bush’s words once again: “A great nation does not hide its history. It faces its flaws and 
corrects them.” We forget, we deny how much we really depend on each other, how much we 
really need each other. We justify our silence and inaction by manufacturing noble causes that 
marinate in historic denial. We still find a way to say “wait, wait, wait, not so fast.” Dr. Martin 
Luther King Jr. said, “wait has almost always meant never.”2
We can not wait any longer. We need to change. And we need to change now. No more 
waiting. This is not just about statu[es], this is about attitudes; and it's about behaviors as 
well. If we take down these statu[es] and don’t change to become a more open and inclusive 
society, then all of this would have all been in vain.
While some have driven by these statu[es] every day and either revered their beauty or failed 
to see them at all, many of our neighbors and our fellow Americans see them very, very 
clearly. Many are painfully aware of their long shadows, their presence cast not only literally 
but figuratively. And they clearly receive the message that the Confederacy and the cult of the 
Lost Cause intended to deliver.
Earlier this week, as the cult of the Lost Cause statu[e] P.G.T Beauregard came down, world 
renowned musician Terence Blanchard, who's with us, stood watch with his wife Robin and 
their two beautiful daughters at their side. You see, Terence went to school on the edge of 
City Park, at a school named after one of America’s great heroes and patriots, John F. 
Kennedy. But to get there he had to pass by the monument to a man who fought to deny his 
humanity. 
And he said (quote):
I’ve never looked at them as a source of pride. It always made me feel as if they were 
put there by people who don’t respect us. This is something I never thought I’d see in 
my lifetime. It’s a sign that the world is changing.
Yes, Terence, it is, and it is long overdue. Now is the time to send a new message to the next 
generation of New Orleanians, a message about the future, about the next 300 years and 
beyond: Let us not miss this opportunity New Orleans and let us help the rest of the America 
do the same, because now -- see, now -- is the time for choosing. Now is the time to actually 
make this city the city we should have always been had we gotten it right the first time.
But, this is a good place to stop for a moment and ask ourselves at this point in our history --
 after Katrina, after Rita, after Ike, after Gustav, after the national recession, after the BP oil 
spill catastrophe, after the tornado -- if presented with an opportunity to build monuments 
that told our story or curate these particular spaces … would these be the monuments that we 
want the world to see? Is this really our story?
You see, we have not erased history. We're becoming part of the city’s history by righting the 
wrong image these monuments represent and crafting a better, more complete future for all 
of our children, and for future generations. And unlike when these Confederate monuments 
were erected as symbols of white supremacy, we now have a chance to create not only new 
symbols, but to do it together, as one people. In our blessed land, we come to the table of 
democracy as equals.
We have to reaffirm our commitment to a future where each citizen is guaranteed the 
uniquely American gifts of "Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of happiness."3 That is what really 
makes America great and today it's more important than ever to hold fast to these values and 
together say a self-evident truth that out of many we are one. That is why we reclaim these 
spaces for the United States of America, because we are one nation, not two; indivisible with 
liberty and justice for all, not some. We all are part of one nation and pledge allegiance to one 
flag, the flag of the United States of America.
And here -- And here's the kicker: New Orleanians are in it all of the way. It is in this union, it 
is in this truth that real patriotism is rooted and it flourishes. Instead of revering a four-year 
brief historical aberration that was called the Confederacy, we can celebrate all 300 years of 
our rich, diverse history as a place named New Orleans and set the tone for the next 300 
years.
After decades of public debate, of anger, of anxiety, of anticipation, of humiliation and of 
frustration; after public hearings and approvals from three separate community boards and 
commissions; after two robust public hearings and a 6-1 vote by our duly-elected City 
Council; after review by 13 different federal and state judges: The full weight of the 
legislative, executive, and judicial branches of government has been brought to bear and that 
is why these monuments are coming down in accordance with the law and will be removed.
So, now is the time to come together to heal and to focus on our larger task -- not only 
building new symbols, but making this city a beautiful manifestation of what is possible and 
what we as a people can become. And so, let us remember the once-exiled, imprisoned, and 
universally loved now Nelson Mandela and what he said after apartheid:
If the pain has often been unbearable and the revelations shocking to all of us, it is 
because they indeed bring us the beginnings of a common understanding of what 
happened and a steady restoration of th[e] nation’s humanity.
So before we part let us again state clearly for all to hear: The Confederacy was on the wrong 
side of history and humanity. It sought to tear apart our nation and subjugate our fellow 
Americans to slavery. This is a history we should never forget and one that we should never, 
ever again put on a pedestal to be revered.
As a community, we must recognize the significance of removing New Orleans’ Confederate 
monuments. It is our acknowledgment that now is a time to take stock of, and then move 
past, a painful part of our history. Anything less would render generations of courageous 
struggle and soul-searching a truly lost cause. Anything less would fall short of the immortal 
words of our greatest President, Abraham Lincoln, who, with an open heart and a clarity of 
purpose, calls on us today across the ages to unite as one people when he said:
With malice toward none; with charity for all; with firmness in [the] right, as God gives 
us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in; to bind up the nation’s 
wounds...to do all which may achieve and cherish a just, and a lasting peace, among 
ourselves, and with all nations.4
God bless you all.
God bless New Orleans. 
And God bless the United States of America.
